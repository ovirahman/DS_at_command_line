# 2.5 For Further Exploration
* The subtitle of this book pays homage to the epic Unix Power Tools by Jerry Peek, Shelley Powers, Tim O’Reilly, and Mike Loukides. And rightly so. In 51 chapters and more than a thousand pages, it covers just about everything there is to know about Unix. It weighs over 4 pounds, so you might want to consider getting the ebook.

* The website explainshell parses a command or a sequence of commands and provides a short explanation of each part. Useful for quickly understanding a new command or option without having to skim through the relevant manual pages.

* Docker is truly a brilliant piece of software. In this chapter I’ve briefly explained how to download a Docker image and run a Docker container, but it might be worthwhile to learn how to create your own Docker images. The book Docker: Up & Running by Sean Kane and Karl Matthias is a good resource as well.
