# 2.5 For Further Exploration
* The subtitle of this book pays homage to the epic Unix Power Tools by Jerry Peek, Shelley Powers, Tim O’Reilly, and Mike Loukides. And rightly so.

* The website explainshell parses a command or a sequence of commands and provides a short explanation of each part. Useful for quickly understanding a new command or option without having to skim through the relevant manual pages.

* Docker is truly a brilliant piece of software. In this chapter I’ve briefly explained how to download a Docker image and run a Docker container, but it might be worthwhile to learn how to create your own Docker images. The book Docker: Up & Running by Sean Kane and Karl Matthias is a good resource as well.
